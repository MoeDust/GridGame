# The Grid Game

Todayâ€™s power grid is a utility which provides a lot of people with electrical energy throughout their day. Over the years the power grid has become increasingly complex, 
particularly due to the increasing share of renewable energy sources. 
Even when understanding how it works, it would be beneficial to provide a visual tool to see how it behaves under different circumstances. 
This could be achieved in numerous ways. One of which is turning it into a game that challenges the player to think more like a grid operator.

This game should give the player a basic understanding of the problems faced each day by the transmission service operator.
