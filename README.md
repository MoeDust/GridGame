# The Grid Game

This is a copy of a semester thesis I did during my master in electrical engineering.
It is a prototype of an educational game that is supposed to teach people how the electrical grid needs to be balanced at all times and how daily operations might work.

It is written in **C#** and uses **MonoGame/XNA** as a framework for everything.
For some matrix calculations the library **Math.NET Numerics** was used.

This is the original description from the README of the thesis repo:

Todayâ€™s power grid is a utility which provides a lot of people with electrical energy throughout their day. Over the years the power grid has become increasingly complex, 
particularly due to the increasing share of renewable energy sources. 
Even when understanding how it works, it would be beneficial to provide a visual tool to see how it behaves under different circumstances. 
This could be achieved in numerous ways. One of which is turning it into a game that challenges the player to think more like a grid operator.

This game should give the player a basic understanding of the problems faced each day by the transmission service operator.
