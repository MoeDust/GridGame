This game shows in different scenarios how the power grid operates. 
To control the game, click the different buses and use the arrow keys
to change their power. Negative power indicates that the bus is a generator.

Arrow key up         Increase the power of the active bus
Arrow key down    Decrease the power of the active bus
P                             Pause the simulation
Esc                          Menu
T                             Toggles the text on the lines
Space                      Return to game after events

Winning             You win the level if you survive the 24 gamehours.
Losing                You lose when the system is out of balance for more than 10 seconds.
                          A countdown will be shown whenever the system is out of balance.

The values in the system are given in per unit (p.u.). This means that all the powers 
are in proportion to each other. So, if one power is 1 p.u. in the game and 10 MW in 
real life and another power is 2 p.u. in the game, this second power would be 20 MW 
in real life.
