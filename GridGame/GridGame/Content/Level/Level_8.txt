Events
Nr	BUS_id	Start	End	P_diff	Text
8	0	1	2	0.5	The water level is lower than expected. So, the hydro power decreases slightly.
6	4	3	4  	0	A substation had technical problems and the powerline \nbetween bus 2 and 3 had to be taken out of order.
2	0	5	15	0.5	Some wind is coming up.
4	0	8	9	3	The fossil power plant had to deliver its auctioned secondary reserve energy.
3	0	11	14	0.6	A cloud is covering the sky and PV energy decreases by 40%. \nThe sky will be cleared at 14 o'clock as predicted.
7	4	13	14	0	Finally, they did it! The power line is back on.
2	0	14	21	1	A storm is coming up. Wind production increases.
8	0	19	20	-2	Due to the storm the rivers carry more water. \nTherefore, the hydro power plants increased their production.
5	0	22	23	-2	It is already nighttime. The consumption of the households decreased.

Generation/Consumption-Description:
S: Slack-Bus			Is balancing all the powers and 
P: Photovoltaic-Generation	only negative Power due to Generation only, automatically increases during daytime to the maximal Power P_min
W: Wind turbine			only negative Power due to Generation only and wind turbine only starts caused by an event
H: Hydropower			only negative Power due to Generation only
G: Generation from fossil fuels	only negative Power due to Generation only
C: Consumer (households)	only positive Power due to Consumption only


Events-Nr.-Description:
1: Individual Event depending on Bus_id (not possible with PV or wind turbine buses)
2: More or less wind, wind power increases after "Start" time and decreases until the "End" time. Its maximum is thereby P_min times the factor (between 0 and 1) at P_diff
3: More or less sunlight, power of PV-system increases or decreases by the factor stated at P_diff (between 0 and 1)
4: Fossil fuel generator has a problem and power decreases
5: All Consumer vary of expected consumption (for example too cold weather -> heating)
6: A line breaks down, write instead of BUS_id the Line_id you want to take out of order
7: A line comes back into use, write instead of BUS_id the Line_id of the mentioned line 
8: More or less water is available due to rain or dry period, power increases or decreases at hydro power plants 
// Events are not allowed to have the same start time.
