Possible use of batteries in the future

To improve the use of batteries compared to level 6 we now
have batteries which are orientated on the overall system 
energy surplus (not changeable) and we have batteries which
you can charge or discharge whenever you would like.

Click on the batteries to discover if they are changeable.

Generation/Consumption-Description:
S: Slack-Bus			Is balancing all the powers and 
P: Photovoltaic-Generation	only negative Power due to Generation only, automatically increases during daytime to the maximal Power P_min
W: Wind turbine			only negative Power due to Generation only and wind turbine only starts caused by an event
H: Hydropower			only negative Power due to Generation only
G: Generation from fossil fuels	only negative Power due to Generation only
C: Consumer (households)	only positive Power due to Consumption only


Events-Nr.-Description:
1: Individual Event depending on Bus_id (not possible with PV or wind turbine buses)
2: More or less wind, wind power increases after "Start" time and decreases until the "End" time. Its maximum is thereby P_min times the factor (between 0 and 1) at P_diff
3: More or less sunlight, power of PV-system increases or decreases by the factor stated at P_diff (between 0 and 1)
4: Fossil fuel generator has a problem and power decreases
5: All Consumer vary of expected consumption (for example too cold weather -> heating)
6: A line breaks down, write instead of BUS_id the Line_id you want to take out of order
7: A line comes back into use, write instead of BUS_id the Line_id of the mentioned line 
8: More or less water is available due to rain or dry period, power increases or decreases at hydro power plants 
// Events are not allowed to have the same start time.
