Challenging level

In this level, you can prove that you master all the elements 
of a power grid. This level has less tolerance than all other 
levels and is therefore more difficult to complete.

Good luck!

Generation/Consumption-Description:
S: Slack-Bus			Is balancing all the powers and 
P: Photovoltaic-Generation	only negative Power due to Generation only, automatically increases during daytime to the maximal Power P_min
W: Wind turbine			only negative Power due to Generation only and wind turbine only starts caused by an event
H: Hydropower			only negative Power due to Generation only
G: Generation from fossil fuels	only negative Power due to Generation only
C: Consumer (households)	only positive Power due to Consumption only


Events-Nr.-Description:
1: Individual Event depending on Bus_id (not possible with PV or wind turbine buses)
2: More or less wind, wind power increases after "Start" time and decreases until the "End" time. Its maximum is thereby P_min times the factor (between 0 and 1) at P_diff
3: More or less sunlight, power of PV-system increases or decreases by the factor stated at P_diff (between 0 and 1)
4: Fossil fuel generator has a problem and power decreases
5: All Consumer vary of expected consumption (for example too cold weather -> heating)
6: A line breaks down, write instead of BUS_id the Line_id you want to take out of order
7: A line comes back into use, write instead of BUS_id the Line_id of the mentioned line 
8: More or less water is available due to rain or dry period, power increases or decreases at hydro power plants 
// Events are not allowed to have the same start time.
