Try out how the system works.

In this level, you have the chance to find out how the 
generators and loads work and how you can manipulate them.
The description can also be found in the menu under 
"How to play".

So, get started.

1	1	0.2	1	0	You can change the power of hydro and fossil power plants with the keys up and down. \nTherefore click first on the power plant you want to change. \nTry it out. Press space to continue.
1	1	3	4	0	With the key T you can turn on and off the written information to the lines.
1	1	5	6	0	With the key P you can pause the time to take a break. \nIn the left lower corner you can always find the daytime of the game.
1	1	6	7	0	With Esc you get back to the menu. \nThere you find also the "How to play" if you need to see the key definitions again.
1	1	7	8	0	Finally, there can occur an event any time. \nTheir description will pop up like these learning massages.  	 	
1	2	8	9	4	The generating fossil power plant had to be taken out of order due to overheating. \nNow keep the system stable.
1	1	12	13	0	If the countdown time is too fast, you can change it in the menu under "Options" and restart the level. 
1	4	13	15	-3	Due to a lot of rain, the hydro power plant works now at full capacity.
6	2	18	19	0	A tree has fallen onto the powerline. Therefore, it has been disconnected.
5	0	22	23	-1	It is night time so the consumer need less energy.

Generation/Consumption-Description:
S: Slack-Bus			Is balancing all the powers and 
P: Photovoltaic-Generation	only negative Power due to Generation only, automatically increases during daytime to the maximal Power P_min
W: Wind turbine			only negative Power due to Generation only and wind turbine only starts caused by an event
H: Hydropower			only negative Power due to Generation only
G: Generation from fossil fuels	only negative Power due to Generation only
C: Consumer (households)	only positive Power due to Consumption only


Events-Nr.-Description:
1: Individual Event depending on Bus_id (not possible with PV or wind turbine buses)
2: More or less wind, wind power increases after "Start" time and decreases until the "End" time. Its maximum is thereby P_min times the factor (between 0 and 1) at P_diff
3: More or less sunlight, power of PV-system increases or decreases by the factor stated at P_diff (between 0 and 1)
4: Fossil fuel generator has a problem and power decreases
5: All Consumer vary of expected consumption (for example too cold weather -> heating)
6: A line breaks down, write instead of BUS_id the Line_id you want to take out of order
7: A line comes back into use, write instead of BUS_id the Line_id of the mentioned line 
8: More or less water is available due to rain or dry period, power increases or decreases at hydro power plants 
// Events are not allowed to have the same start time.
